# Laptop_Price_Prediction

### Objective:

We are required to model the price of Laptops with the available independent variables. The Objective is to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent features based on  their characteristics, essential factors using different regression models and to analyze the correlation between specs and laptop price.

### LIBRARIES USED

Pandas, matplot(visualizing), seaborn(visualizing) for EDA

Prediciton method used here is Multiple Linear Regression
Linear Regression,
Ridge,
Lasso
KNeighbors Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Ada Boost Regressor
Support Vector Regressor


### FEATURE ELIMINATION 
Features that are not contributing are eliminated using pearson correlation coefficient


### EVALUATION
Evaluated the model using r2 method and got a score of 88.7%. So, the prediction model is correct 88% of the time.
